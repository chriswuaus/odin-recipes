    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      To avoid watery lasagna, make sure your lasagna noodles are drained
      properly before layering. Once they are cooked and drained, do not rinse
      with water but immediately place in a single layer on a lightly oiled
      tray. Not rinsing in water will allow the sauce to cling to the starches
      on the noodle. If using cottage cheese, drain it for an hour or so before
      using. Simmer the sauce for at least 30 minutes uncovered to allow excess
      water to evaporate. Also, uncover the lasagna during the last 25 minutes
      of baking to release any extra moisture in the pan.
